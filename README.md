# trinoTile
## Implements a recursive divide and conquer algorithm to solve the triomino tiling problem for a 2^n x 2^n matrix.

This program demonstrates the implementation and operation of a divide and conquer algorithm to 
solve the triomino tiling problem.

“Given a 2n×2 n checkerboard with one square missing, construct a tiling of this checkerboard 
using right triominoes (i.e., L-triomino with three squares). Write a C or C++ program to solve this 
problem. The input is an integer n ≥ 3 and the position of the missing square. The output is a 
tiling of the 2^n × 2^n checkerboard with one square missing (the position of the missing square is 
part of the input).”

Inputs:
- Input N to form a 2^n x 2^n matrix
- Input X to define the zero indexed row location of the missing square
- Input Y to define the zero indexed column location of the missing square

Outputs:

- The program produces graphical terminal output in the form of the generated matrix with numbered 
triomino tiles completing the remaining spaces as per the algorithm design
